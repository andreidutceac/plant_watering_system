# plant_watering_system
DIY home project involving the use of a microcontroller and a water pump for automated plant watering.

## Intro
This project is a smart way of using microcontrollers for watering plants when you are not home or when you forget about it. You 
can define the time you want to water the plant and the quantity of water to use.

## Hardware components
**1. Microcontroller** (In my case i use a NUCLEO-F070RB board but you can use any other mcu)

**2. Water pump**

**3. 5V Battery**

**4. Relay module**

**5. Vinyl tube for pump**

## Software

For STM boards i use **Mbed Studio**
